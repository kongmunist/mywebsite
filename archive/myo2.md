snippet: How to lay out 50 components on a board really fast

Hello! This is Andy. I've made some progress on my EMG circuit since last year, and by that I mean I've iterated exactly once. While assembling my second iteration, I decided to bite the bullet and order a PCB stencil so I would have an easier time putting together the board. It was really quite fun, so I've decided to share the process and my thoughts on it. 

You need to have 
- your blank, unpopulated PCB
- the PCB's stencil
- Solder paste
- a credit card or something similar
- other blank, unpopulated PCBs to support the stencil
- tape
- reflow oven or hot-air gun
