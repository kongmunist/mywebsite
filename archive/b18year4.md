snippet: To enable powering all lithium battery devices with chunky supercaps instead

This past weekend, I attended my last Build18 as an undergrad. Build18 is a hardware hackathon at CMU which gives student teams a $300 budget to buy any parts they want, to build any project they'd like. 

In my first year, my team worked on a robot dog made of laser-cut acrylic and 12 servos off Amazon. Having no MechE students really hits different on a robotics project, but we made a dog-shaped chassis capable of standing up on its own. 

My second year, I wanted to create a [space elevator]() using a large capacitor bank. This project presented a good excuse for making a coilgun, and we blew up a couple of resistors in the process. 

Anyway
