description: Super-sizing Arugula plants by messing with their genes


Hello! My name is Andy, and I really like eating Arugula. Also known as rocket, arugula is a vegetable with a strong, savory flavor, and it's very nutritious (or at least it makes me feel healthy). It only has one problem though: the leaves are fairly small, and it goes bad in about a week or so.

Usually I'd just buy it from the store. However, I have an apartment on a year-long lease, so I figured I could just grow it myself and have fresh arugula on-tap, whenever I wanted it. This would solve the freshness aspect, but not the fact that the leaves are small. What to do? 

## Inducing Polyploidy
As I sat there pondering my arugula troubles, I suddenly remembered a factoid that my middle school science teacher had taught us during the genetics unit. When an organism's cells carry more than two pairs of its chromosomes, it's known as polyploidy. He then mentioned that plants experiencing polyploidy will have larger cells when grown than those without polyploidy. As a result, causing a plant to mutate and undergo polyploidy causes it to grow bigger stems and fruit. 

We don't even need radiation to do this: we've been doing it to our crops for hundreds of years. By artificial selection, we have caused wheat to split into three different species with 2, 4 and 6 pairs of chromosomes [(Source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploidy). Other fruit, most notably strawberries, can carry up to 16 copies of their chromosome because of how much we've selected for larger fruit. If you've ever wondered why wild strawberry are so small, here's your answer.

Though my teacher only mentioned if off-hand, I've been looking into home gardening using polyploidy. Polyploidy is most commonly caused in plants using chemicals — the most popular one being colchicine. However, colchicine has some carcinogenic attributes, and another chemical (sold as herbicide) called oryzalin works just as well without the risk of cancer. 

### A few downsides
There are a few problems with this technique. Polyploided plants are usually infertile, producing shrunken seeds that won't sprout again. Also, using colchicine or orzyalin on the plants carries an inherent risk of killing the seed; because of this, treated seeds have a germination rate about half that of untreated seeds. Finally, polyploidy plants will grow a little slower than their untreated counterparts (about 90% the speed). 

Besides the logistical issues of getting extra seeds and caring for them a little longer, the end product of a polyploidied plant has no such issues. The fruit are healthy, tasty, and won't give you polyploidy — in short, perfectly fine to eat. 

## Setup
I originally wanted to grow tomato plants. I stole some seeds from a friend's mom's garden, and bought the orzyalin. It came in a little jug. However, I read a paper and thought about it and realized that the polyploided tomatoes could end up smaller overall than untreated ones. Here's why. Tomatoes are mostly liquid, and much of their mass comes from the seeds inside the tomato. Since the tomatos would have shrunken seeds, the tomato would lose a lot of its mass and we'd end up with less tomato overall. I also didn't have the room to grow full tomato vines, so I pivoted and bought some arugula seeds.

## Oryzalin dilution
I needed to know exactly what concentration of oryzalin to use to polyploid the plants; too much and the plants all die (it is a herbicide), too little and nothing happens. I couldn't find any prior research on polyploiding arugula in particular, but I figured if the cells got bigger, the leaves would also get bigger. I used [this paper](https://journals.ashs.org/hortsci/view/journals/hortsci/43/7/article-p2248.xml) as reference, since they were growing flowers (petals are like leaves, right?). They had best results using a 120 µM solution of oryzalin for 48 hours, 40% of the seeds germinated and half of those were polyploid. 

Using the molar mass of 346.36 g·mol−1, 120 µM becomes 0.0087%. The oryzalin came as a 40.4% solution, making for a final dilution of 4,643. Oryzalin, sold here as Surflan, is a thick, fluorescent orange liquid. I only had a gram scale and a gallon container (3785 grams/gallon of water), so I measured out about a gram and relied on some of the gram sticking to the sheet I measured it out on. Chemistry is an approximate science when you live in a college dorm.

I stirred it around a bit, then made two bags of 100 grams of the solution each. I had seen another paper use DMSO as an organic solvent to help the oryzalin penetrate into the seeds better, so one bag got a gram of DMSO to make a 1% DMSO solution.

I split the seed bag into three groups: an oryzalin treatment, an oryzalin+DMSO treatment, and a control group. I added the seeds to their labeled bags. The final bag of untreated seeds was left dry. This was a scientific mistake on my part, since the other seeds began to sprout underwater and got a bit of a head start over the control group.

However, in the end it didn't matter: the control group sprouted way faster than either of the treated groups

## Results
Over the first few days, I kept a log of photos and how many plants had sprouted. 



Here's the deal: I study computer science. I am not a gardener. I didn't realize that the control group would begin to get very crowded in such a small space. I also didn't realize that I could overwater plants.
