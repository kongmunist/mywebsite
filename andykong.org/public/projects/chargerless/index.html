            <html><body><p>Hello! Usually I write up a project after it's done, but this time I'm going to explain it to you as it's happening. Check out the website at <a href="https://chargerless.xyz/">chargerless.xyz</a></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" class="addpic" src="/static/chargerless/beaut.jpg"/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<hr/>
<h1 id="chargerless-manifesto">Chargerless Manifesto</h1>
<p>Between 20-40% of the US adult population owns a fitness tracker, and I haven't met a single person who likes how they look. At best the wearable is tolerated, "discreet <i>enough</i>" ; at worst it sticks out like a stain on a nice white shirt. </p>
<p class="caption"> Chunky, chunky, chunky </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chunky, chunky, chunky" class="addpic" src="/static/chargerless/clunky.avif"/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>But do wearables today "earn their keep" through their functionality in spite of how they look? No! Outside of the top 1% most fitness-brained users, I'd argue that everyone else mostly uses it to check the time. That is, when their device isn't dead.</p>
<p>What's up with this? If everyone is wearing ugly bricks on their wrists, why hasn't anyone showed up with a nice, sleek, "looks like jewelry" wearable yet? The answer is an old way of thinking about the core component that all wearables share: the battery.</p>
<p class="caption"> Oops! All Battery </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Oops! All Battery" class="addpic" src="/static/chargerless/allbats.jpg"/></p>
<p>It goes something like this: the engineers say "this feature needs this much power per day", and the designers say "this should only get charged once a week", then they ship the product. Since everyone has access to the same battery technology, this means that today's wearables all carry around 200mAh of lithium to power their sensor and communication stack, which is why they're all the same size and can barely last a week.</p>
<p>Can we do better?</p>
<hr/>
<h1 id="going-chargerless">Going Chargerless</h1>
<p>Chargerless is a rethinking of the way personal devices have always been powered. Instead of making the user top up their watch every day, what if wearables charged themselves just by being worn around? What if, like the previous generation of self-winding watches, our wearables could power themselves using the heat or light or motion they see every day? </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" class="addpic" src="/static/chargerless/handshot.jpg"/></p>
<p>First, it'd be incredibly convenient to never worry again about charging your watch. And as a second order effect â€” if your wearable is always charging, we can use a much smaller battery to get the same functionality that we're used to: heart rate, sleep, and activity tracking without any of the hassle.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" class="addpic" src="/static/chargerless/beaut.jpg"/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1 id="why-now">Why now?</h1>
<p>Energy harvesting has been studied for decades, but only recently have low-power microcontrollers caught up. The current generation of chips can run sensors, process data, and transmit signals wirelessly, all from a silicon chip smaller than a salt grain â€” the primary limitation is a way of thinking about power: how to use it and where it comes from. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="" class="addpic" src="/static/chargerless/smallenough.jpg"/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 id="now-is-the-right-time">Now is the right time:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Truly continuous biometrics data integrated across data sources can revolutionize medicine, and you can't get data from the past, we must start now. But non-tech audiences don't like the cold and bulky look of today's wearable trackers.</li>
<li>Smaller designs which solve this are enabled by our power harvesting stack and modern advancements in semiconductors, alleviating the primary pain points of wearables (low battery, bad aesthetics)</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p><hr/>
<h1 id="financials">Financials</h1>
<p>A 2019 Pew Research <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/FT_2020.01.07_FitnessTracker_Methodology-_Topline_final.pdf">survey</a> reports that 21% of US adults regularly wear a fitness device. Applied to the US, we get ~70 million devices in circulation and a market size of ~80 B (<a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/wearable-technology-market">source</a>). </p>
<p>The Ray band is intended as both a consumer's first product in this space and a replacement device for existing fitness users â€” we will grow the pie and take a big slice. The top two quitting reasons for fitness users are the aesthetics (~20%) and battery life (~18%), which are an entangled problem solved by our new device, and conversions on existing users can easily hit ~14M users. I'm extremely excited to boost average health across the population, and have it done effortlessly. </p>
<h1 id="marketing">Marketing</h1>
<p>Our target audience is primarily people in their mid-20s to late 40s â€” with friends and family members to care about and keep up with through day-to-day wellness. A lot of outreach will happen via word-of-mouth, gifts, being active on forums, and social media. Traditional web media will also play a big role for the slightly older end of our target audience. We think this will work for two reasons. </p>
<ol>
<li>More data, more insights. Today's trackers can tell your sleep impacted your day, but not much more, which makes it hard to justify their annoyance. We want to do more than that, to expand the data sources that a user can analyze and self-improve upon, and deliver novel insights across the mind-body axis.</li>
<li>Modern wearables do not lean into the social spread factor because the modern wearable is a bad gift â€” it looks like a device, and needs daily maintenance. Chargerless can be gifted to your grandma or your kid or your dog because it works "for free" and has a minimal look, and we'll focus marketing on families, couples, and friend groups, which we believe is a stickier way to get people to care about their health, and is an angle that other wearable companies can't compete on. </li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<h1 id="hows-it-going">How's it going?</h1>
<p>It's going great, and there's a lot left to do!</p>
<p>Chargerless was loosely started ~fall 2024 as a series of disconnected experiments; Digikey deep dives, napkin math, and de-risking various pieces of the puzzle. The vision coalesced around January of this year, then in July I incorporated and moved to SF to work on Chargerless full-time. </p>
<p class="caption"> Programming on test boards </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Programming on test boards" class="addpic" src="/static/chargerless/stabby.jpg"/></p>
<p>We're making strong progress thanks to our early angel investors. At our current rate of development, we plan to ship out 100 beta devices to paid users by November 2025 for tuning and testing (list is ~80% full, please DM me if you'd like to join the list!). The next time you'll be able to get one will be the first public batch around next year.</p>
