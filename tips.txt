MARKDOWN JINJA - Used some workaround I found on Stack Overflow to render jinja templates ({{}}) before rendering markdown for the project and blog posts. now i can use url_for on images in .md files
IMAGES - mx-auto centers, d-block prevents it from being inline. SOMETIMES YOU NEED BOTH, using class="d-block mx-auto" for <img>
IMAGE TEXT - Images in md have to be beside a text block (touching, 1 \n) or else the headers (###) will attach to the sides -.-
JINJA TEMPLATES - Can nest multiple templates (base extends to aboutsidebar extends to every blog and tag page) by making abousidebar extend base and then "extends aboutsidebar.html" instead of base.
SITUATIONAL - remove the href from the <a> class info in projectsmain and the text will change color.
CSS - pointers can be changed to be a multitude of special icons, that's browser rendered.
HTML - .div onclick can make them links without having to mess with <a> tags surrounding them
JINJA - allow functions from sitebuilder.py to be called in the html {{}} things by updating flask global variables. app.jinja_env.globals.update(clever_function=clever_function)
METADATA YML - Calling page.meta.date renders automatically as a datetime.date object, no need to parse a string
HTML - you wrote a <p class="caption"> for making captions below images. It's hella useful
BLOG IMAGES - TEMPLATE is <img class="d-block mx-auto" src="{{ url_for('static',filename='filename.png') }}"/>
BOOTSTRAP - if you want to center text, use class=text-center and don't put a row around it
YOUTUBE EMBEDDED - to center it, make a div around it with style="text-align:center;" and class="d-block mx-auto", i don't know which one is necessary
HTML - On a new page (like tagmain), if the bat content doesn't have an additional div all the formatting goes to hell. Place a div as the first thing in {{} bat_content} or whatever
HTML/JS - if you try to set the style by doing elem.style.fontSize = "100%";, make SURE you don't put "100%;" with a semicolon inside the thing. It'll terminate it all on its own, but you putting the ; makes it reject the string. So much for being concientious :(.
CSS - Need both "backdrop-filter: blur(4px)" and "-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(4px)" to make the blur happen in Safari.
CSS Animations - The from needs to have all details, but the "to" doesn't. You already know the to, it's in the object's specification that records which animation is happening. 
JINJA - "300 kHz to 1 kHz faster than you can say \"free bits\"" is how you add quotes. You're welcome. I think other forbidden characters can be added like this too.
