MARKDOWN JINJA - Used some workaround I found on Stack Overflow to render jinja templates ({{}}) before rendering markdown for the project and blog posts. now i can use url_for on images in .md files
IMAGES - mx-auto centers, d-block prevents it from being inline. SOMETIMES YOU NEED BOTH, using class="d-block mx-auto" for <img>
IMAGE TEXT - Images in md have to be beside a text block (touching, 1 \n) or else the headers (###) will attach to the sides -.-
JINJA TEMPLATES - Can nest multiple templates (base extends to aboutsidebar extends to every blog and tag page) by making abousidebar extend base and then "extends aboutsidebar.html" instead of base.
