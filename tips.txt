MARKDOWN JINJA - Used some workaround I found on Stack Overflow to render jinja templates ({{}}) before rendering markdown for the project and blog posts. now i can use url_for on images in .md files
IMAGES - mx-auto centers, d-block prevents it from being inline. SOMETIMES YOU NEED BOTH, using class="d-block mx-auto" for <img>
IMAGE TEXT - Images in md have to be beside a text block (touching, 1 \n) or else the headers (###) will attach to the sides -.-
JINJA TEMPLATES - Can nest multiple templates (base extends to aboutsidebar extends to every blog and tag page) by making abousidebar extend base and then "extends aboutsidebar.html" instead of base.
SITUATIONAL - remove the href from the <a> class info in projectsmain and the text will change color.
CSS - pointers can be changed to be a multitude of special icons, that's browser rendered.
HTML - .div onclick can make them links without having to mess with <a> tags surrounding them
JINJA - allow functions from sitebuilder.py to be called in the html {{}} things by updating flask global variables. app.jinja_env.globals.update(clever_function=clever_function)
METADATA YML - Calling page.meta.date renders automatically as a datetime.date object, no need to parse a string
HTML - you wrote a <p class="caption"> for making captions below images. It's hella useful
BLOG IMAGES - TEMPLATE is <img class="d-block mx-auto" src="{{ url_for('static',filename='filename.png') }}"/>
BOOTSTRAP - if you want to center text, use class=text-center and don't put a row around it
YOUTUBE EMBEDDED - to center it, make a div around it with style="text-align:center;" and class="d-block mx-auto", i don't know which one is necessary. EDIT it's the first one, the text-align center.
HTML - On a new page (like tagmain), if the bat content doesn't have an additional div all the formatting goes to hell. Place a div as the first thing in {{} bat_content} or whatever
HTML/JS - if you try to set the style by doing elem.style.fontSize = "100%";, make SURE you don't put "100%;" with a semicolon inside the thing. It'll terminate it all on its own, but you putting the ; makes it reject the string. So much for being concientious :(.
CSS - Need both "backdrop-filter: blur(4px)" and "-webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(4px)" to make the blur happen in Safari.
CSS Animations - The from needs to have all details, but the "to" doesn't. You already know the to, it's in the object's specification that records which animation is happening. 
JINJA - "300 kHz to 1 kHz faster than you can say \"free bits\"" is how you add quotes. You're welcome. I think other forbidden characters can be added like this too.
HTML - center tables using "margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
JAVASCRIPT - cannot add buttons with onclick attribute to a <p> tag. Just doesn't work. 
JAVASCRIPT - Internet Explorer doesn't support arrow notation for functions
TWITTER - use the class "tw-align-center" to center embedded tweets
NEW LAPTOP SETUP - Good job on the new computer! I hope it's faster than your brain. Anyway, do this:
    1. pip install everything in the sitebuilder.py imports, 
    2. download the site scripts from github, give them new pictures
        3. Run each one to make sure they work
    4. Download firebase (which you'll need npm to do (which you'll need nvm to do))
    5. Make sure your "git push origin" works. It probably doesn't since the ssh keys don't get carried over. You'll have to refollow this guide: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/troubleshooting-ssh/error-permission-denied-publickey
    6. Should be done. Enjoy!
