TODO:
- make GIFs into videos
- Make the images on the front page snap into position following a random path
- Add a now page

November 25, 2022 - Downloaded the jquery and other stuff at the bottom so it loads locally. Thank you Jeff Huang @ Brown. Also added goatcounter analytics to try it out. Also realized the font-awesome pack is actually downloading the sprites from the website even though I'm hosting the .js file. Need to move away from that
October 13, 2022 - Added image max width to projects page, also made H1 and H2 a darker color on blog posts. Also removed margin-top of 1em from all h1 h2 in blogs, just added it to the first one. Also on blog posts page, I made all the text a brighter color that darkens when hovered. Also I rearranged the title/snippet/date etxt so the date is now inline with everything on the right.
October 4, 2022 - Fixed how images are sized on blog posts, hopefully for the last time. Making great use of the max-width and max-height features, constraining them to be no bigger than 1/4 of the screen at any point. Should do this to projects page as well.
July 14, 2022 - Excited for L to get here. Uploaded Igneous, in the process made a YouTube video CSS tag, a Youtube container tag, fixed how images are sized on projects for mobile and web, and re-centered the projects images. Also made images center by default, which could bring problems. Keep an eye out.
June 27, 2022 - Added image centering for the front page by adding display:flex and justify-content: center to the "hovercontent" CSS class. Gonna have to resize some of the images. Also rounded the captions on the main page. Also added more elastic animations to the front page. Also made it so projects on the front page won't show up if they're from the future.
June 25, 2022 - Started work at Google, still writing proposal and we're on week 4. Time flies! Added picture previews to Sublime by modifying a plugin.
April 22, 2022 - Graduating from college in 3 weeks. Added a jinja pre-processor to add pictures to the website more easily
Feb 5, 2022 - Changed blog sidebar picture
Jane 9, 2022 - Howdy, where do I start. Fixed tags at the bottom of blog pages overlapping. Removed about sidebar from blog posts, removed the container too so there's no weird shadow thing (Added noaboutsidebar.html). Removed shadow from blogmain too, and fixed sizing across the whole blog. Removed excess horizontal space so there's no scrollbar, changed navbar collapse breakpoint from lg to md. Added padding and readjusted so it all looks good on mobile and all sizes of the desktop. Let's send it!
Jan 6, 22 - Removed extra words from the tags at bottom of the screen, also gave them little surrounding buttons. Added space before h1 in all blog posts (maybe I should also do it across the whole site too?). Lots of inlining of JS and CSS resources. 
Jan 3, 2022 - HNYE. Removed tags from blogmain, added to individual pages. 
Dec 7, 2021 - Fixed tag pages with uppercase tags to also use pages with lowercase tags. - ITS NOT FIXED YET, NEED TO MIGRATE TO DYNAMIC SITE or do something more clever
November 25, 2021 - Home for Thanksgiving. Migrated to new Macbook Pro. Github Copilot is crazy
November 1, 2021 - Made link highlighting have transitions
Sept 26, 2021 - Changed font site-wide to Akinson Hyperlegible for accessibility. Also added the blurb about PhD programs in my bio
August 28 2021 - Added mathjax, now can do $$ LaTeX but not anything else. So mandatory newline
August 10 2021 - Changed font spacing of headers away from 1px. More legible.
May 14 2021 - Addition of CSS transitions for the project images on main page, creation of sitelog. Even made the project images load for IE people -.- Such a backwards web browser, debugging is terrible I had to upload the whole site like 6 times.
