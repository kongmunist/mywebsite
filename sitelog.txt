Jan 3, 2022 - HNYE. Removed tags from blogmain, added to individual pages. 
Dec 7, 2021 - Fixed tag pages with uppercase tags to also use pages with lowercase tags. - ITS NOT FIXED YET, NEED TO MIGRATE TO DYNAMIC SITE or do something more clever
November 25, 2021 - Home for Thanksgiving. Migrated to new Macbook Pro. Github Copilot is crazy
November 1, 2021 - Made link highlighting have transitions
Sept 26, 2021 - Changed font site-wide to Akinson Hyperlegible for accessibility. Also added the blurb about PhD programs in my bio
August 28 2021 - Added mathjax, now can do $$ LaTeX but not anything else. So mandatory newline
August 10 2021 - Changed font spacing of headers away from 1px. More legible.
May 14 2021 - Addition of CSS transitions for the project images on main page, creation of sitelog. Even made the project images load for IE people -.- Such a backwards web browser, debugging is terrible I had to upload the whole site like 6 times.
