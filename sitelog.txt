Feb 5, 2022 - Changed blog sidebar picture
Jane 9, 2022 - Howdy, where do I start. Fixed tags at the bottom of blog pages overlapping. Removed about sidebar from blog posts, removed the container too so there's no weird shadow thing (Added noaboutsidebar.html). Removed shadow from blogmain too, and fixed sizing across the whole blog. Removed excess horizontal space so there's no scrollbar, changed navbar collapse breakpoint from lg to md. Added padding and readjusted so it all looks good on mobile and all sizes of the desktop. Let's send it!
Jan 6, 22 - Removed extra words from the tags at bottom of the screen, also gave them little surrounding buttons. Added space before h1 in all blog posts (maybe I should also do it across the whole site too?). Lots of inlining of JS and CSS resources. 
Jan 3, 2022 - HNYE. Removed tags from blogmain, added to individual pages. 
Dec 7, 2021 - Fixed tag pages with uppercase tags to also use pages with lowercase tags. - ITS NOT FIXED YET, NEED TO MIGRATE TO DYNAMIC SITE or do something more clever
November 25, 2021 - Home for Thanksgiving. Migrated to new Macbook Pro. Github Copilot is crazy
November 1, 2021 - Made link highlighting have transitions
Sept 26, 2021 - Changed font site-wide to Akinson Hyperlegible for accessibility. Also added the blurb about PhD programs in my bio
August 28 2021 - Added mathjax, now can do $$ LaTeX but not anything else. So mandatory newline
August 10 2021 - Changed font spacing of headers away from 1px. More legible.
May 14 2021 - Addition of CSS transitions for the project images on main page, creation of sitelog. Even made the project images load for IE people -.- Such a backwards web browser, debugging is terrible I had to upload the whole site like 6 times.
