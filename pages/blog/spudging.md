snippet: How to lay out 50 components on a board really fast

Hello! This is Andy. I've made some progress on my EMG circuit since last year, and by that I mean I've iterated exactly once. While assembling my second iteration, I decided to bite the bullet and order a PCB stencil so I would have an easier time putting together the board. It was really quite fun, so I've decided to share the process and my thoughts on it. 

You need to have 
- your blank, unpopulated PCB

- the PCB's stencil

- Solder paste

- a credit card or something similar

- other blank, unpopulated PCBs to support the stencil

- tape

- reflow oven or hot-air gun

# Steps

### 1. Tape your PCB down with some of its friends adjacent

### 2. Place your solder mask over the PCB and align it until you can't see any of the green solder mask. Then tape it down.

### 3. Squeeze out a bit of solder paste and get your scraper tool

### 4. Squeegee the paste over the board. Push down, hard, to ensure no leakage. Only do this step 1-3 times, any more and you'll leak it out

### 5. Check the coverage. If there are some pads that have no grey, touch up those areas locally.

### 6. Remove the solder mask tape carefully, then pull it up from one side. Check the footprints, then add your components

### 7. If they're ready to go, pop it in the reflow oven and hit start. Enjoy the fumes for a few minutes, then inspect your board!

The hardest part is the actual spudging â€” make sure to apply a lot of pressure, but resist the urge to get solid grey filled in on the pads. Don't go over it more than a few times. You'll have a solid uniform grey coating on all the footprints, but they'll leak out the sides and ruin the pads. That's all for now, be safe!
