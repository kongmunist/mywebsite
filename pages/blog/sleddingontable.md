snippet: We had no sled, but we did have an extra folding table

First sticking snow in Pittsburgh today! Me and Elio and Jona wanted to sled, but couldn't find a sled equivalent around the house. Cardboard too soggy and small, container lids too flimsy and weak, no detachable thing on those trashcans anymore :(. What to do? We looked around and found this folding table we had!

It works! Video on my instagram [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIR1Gn6nJ6u/). Not super well since it's so heavy, but you can lift the front and sort of glide down a hill over the ice instead of just plowing into it. Pretty good!
