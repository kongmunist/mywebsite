Hello! Recently I made my first succesful batch of holograms. Here they are:

These holograms use the same silver halide particles as analog film photography, but with approximately 100x smaller crystal size (~10nm). Crystals of silver halide are suspended in gelatin and coated onto one side of the glass plate, this plane is then photoactive.

After a hologram is shot, it's good practice to black out the gelatin side of the hologram as it both protects them and makes them easier to see. After shooting my holograms, I wanted to compare a couple ways to do it and document my results.

# Black Tape

The funny thing about black tape (duct/gaffer) is that usually the sticky side is white. I found electrical tape to have a black sticky side, but wasn't able to find any that was wide enough to cover my glass plates in one piece. I tried abutting them edge-to-edge instead.

You'll notice this kinda works, but the gaps are clearly visible. Even for perfect alignment, there will be a noticeable thin line. There's also some bubbles — these are easy enough to get out by scratching at the tape so it flattens out, but sometimes there are bigger bubbles which do not come out easily. If done carefully it won't look too bad.

# Black Tape, Overlap

If the tape is instead placed over the next piece, this line only gets worse. I cannot recommend this method cause it really sucks.

# Paint

Lastly, I tried a matte black spray paint. One nice thing about this is that we don't really care about the finish on the back side so you can spray a pretty thick single coat. Here is a sheet I taped and spray-painted for comparison.

In the circle above you can see the difference in contrast between tape (bottom) and paint (top). I would say the spray paint is a tad darker, and can go on more evenly. This is definitely the nicest method. 

Anyway, now you know!
