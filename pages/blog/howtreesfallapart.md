snippet: The differing decay patterns of trees during fall

You only get to experience 1 fall a year, and by the time you read this you're probably older than 15. This means you probably have only 65 falls left in you â€” remember to do your best to enjoy each one. 

Anyway, this particular fall I took more of a look at the trees around me. I noticed that the green-yellow-red transition of leaves followed different patterns for different trees, and took photos of all the ones I could. Here follows the decay patterns of 4 different trees.

# 1. Top down

# 2. Inside out

# 3. Outside in

# 4. All at once

Evolutionarily, I'm not sure the decaying has a rhyme or reason. Maybe it makes sense to keep the outer ones green since they receive the most sunlight, but maybe it doesn't matter because red leaves can collect energy as well. Whatever the reason, it makes a beautiful sight.
