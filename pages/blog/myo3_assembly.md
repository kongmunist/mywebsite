snippet: My third PCB!

The PCBs came sometime last week, and I got the rest of my resistors and passives today. Time to construct!

My housemates still are quarantining, so I was trying to stay out of the hallways and common areas (like the workshop we have -.-). I moved all parts into my room, but my desk definitely wasn't bright enough. We make do though. Big shoutout to [HTMLBom](https://github.com/openscopeproject/InteractiveHtmlBom) for enabling my board construction, it's a super useful plugin for KiCAD and you should get it immediately.

### Cool parts of the board:

* Using the TLV2624 to create a virtual ground from my single-sided power supply. It's the laziest way to do it, but I never claimed to be able to do power well.

* This board uses the input stage op-amp with optimal noise, assuming dry electrodes (1 MÎ© resistance). This is the LME49721, with 4nV/rt(Hz) voltage noise and something like 1 fA/rt(Hz) current noise. Funnily enough, it's an audio amp, with lots of Thad graphs all over its datasheet. If it works it works!

* I made two boards actually. After the initial LME49721, I switch to an op amp that can source a little more current and drive more capacitance (for the analog filtering). 
	* One board uses the OPA4202, which can drive INFINITE capacitive load. I chose it because it can do that.
	* The other uses the POPA4991, which can only drive 1nF cap load at gain=1. I chose it because it only needs supply voltage similar to the LME49721, meaning I can use a LiPO to power the board instead of trying to source 5V somewhere.

* It has pads on the back! This allows you to strap it directly to your arm to measure muscle signals. I got really sick of putting those 3M red dot electrodes all over myself, especially when they left glue residue all over me. 

* Guard ring ðŸ˜Ž (really it's kind of useless cause I didn't put it on the back as well, but it's the thought that counts (also, I don't really care about input bias current, up until 1 pA or so. Then it generates (G=100000)\*1pA\*(1 MÎ© skin impedance) = 1 V offset at the end of the circuit, which would definitely pin it to the rails!))

###Problems I ran into: 

* TSSOP 16 pin is *super* tight, it's hard to spudge properly (took me 3 tries). 

* I only had 0402 and 0803 parts, but guess what footprint size I decided to use?? :)))))) Luckily both work, the 0402 is really stretching to reach both pads and it doesn't tack as well to the solder paste, but it still works. 

* Also I shouldn't have picked a black solder mask, I can hardly see the 0402 resistors

* I didn't have 220nF capacitors at all, so I sorta just... skipped it. Luckily, if you know the board, you can just decide whether or not you need a part. This particular one was part of a passive high pass filter, which came before a 2nd order active high pass at the same cutoff frequency. I just removed the cap and resistor, and bridged the resistor pads afterwards.

Gonna spec its noise and stuff soon!
