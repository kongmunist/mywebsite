description: A month of prototyping

Hello everyone! 

In late 2024, I learned that [Cedric Honnet](https://honnet.eu/) would host a cohort of 10 MIT researchers in Shenzhen for the month of January as part of the [Scalable HCI Summit](https://scalablehci.com/2025/program/). On the agenda were factory tours, browsing at electronics malls, and plenty of free time to do whatever your heart desired. To be supported in my prototyping, in the best possble location for electronics development, with a group of similarly-inclined peers — this felt handmade for me. I signed up immediately. 

In the months leading up, I felt both excited because I knew that there would be an unprecedented opportunity for rapid electronics development, yet nervous because I knew I would not be able to make the most of it. For reference, to most engineers an order of electronics takes 4-5 days to arrive from Digikey/Mouser, and a PCB order 4-8 days depending on size and complexity. In Shenzhen, these both happen in 2 days, and even faster if your part isn't super specialized. I felt a lot of pressure to prepare a lot of hardware to be working on, to stagger PCB orders so I'd never be bottlenecked on shipping times but rather handiwork hours. And at the same time I wanted to schedule time to play; to meet new people over meals I'd never had before, to explore the countryside and the harbor, and to visit Hong Kong, and my family in north China. I knew then, and now, that all these things may happen, but they would not all happen — gain through greed is its own punishment. 

Life is fractal, you're born naive with no idea of all that is possible in the world, and we know we can do anything but not everything. And this Shenzhen trip felt like one such Mandelbrot tendril, a microcosm of not knowing and wanting to know, and to do, and to see given limited time. 


The months leading up were both long and short. I felt this incredible opportunity yawning and taunting me; it said you can build anything here, any consumer product, and find the factory willing to make a thousand of them, and you can meet new, interesting people over meals you've never seen before; and you can try to be someone new again. But you will have to choose, because the hand that holds two cookies cannot leave the jar. 




Additionally, the soldering tools were otherworldly.
