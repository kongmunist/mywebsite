description: What is Andy doing in 2024?

It is 2024, and I am leaving my grad studies. I have no job prospects, and no startup money. I have enough savings for a year of living. If my life were a company, this would be my runway. To extend the analogy, I am trying to find Andy-Market Fit.

I always felt that if I were given free rein to follow my curiosity for a while, I would be able to make something cool and useful. At the end of high school, I tried to take a gap year. My parents told me to do it after I finished college. As college ended and I considered grad school, I wanted to take a year off to work on personal projects. My parents encouraged me to get my graduate degree first.

Now, after a year of graduate studies, I realize this will never end. I wanted security, and there is never enough security. There is always more school to finish, more money to save, more career to further before making any leap. I am going to use what I know now to sustain myself. I am going to stop sinning.

# The Plan
This year has no script. I am going to follow my curiosity and rely on my animal mind to stumble onto something good. 

To save myself from sloth, I am instituting one rule — every day I will make something, anything: a video, two sentence tweet, a blog post, project milestone, a letter to a friend. If I'm not on a path to becoming self-sustaining by 2025, total freedom is not for me, and I'll go ahead and get a job like the promising young man I used to be. 

We are calling 2024 the Year of Output.

# Keeping up with Andy

My daily units of output will span my web presence. I will be active on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Medium, my website, Github, Stack Overflow, Twitter, and any other website with an audience and a post button. 

You can follow along via this monthly newsletter I'm starting. I'll post a monthly progress report and retrospective, and it'll also be a good way for me to review. It'll be posted in the updated version of this blog post in a day or two. If you're reading this and there's no link, congrats on being one of the first readers of this post!

I'm also considering starting a Patreon/Kofi. I'm hesitant because I'm planning to work on a variety of things, and my perception of Patreon is that it's more for fans of people working in only one topic for a sustained period. I also don't know how I feel about private content, but it could make for an interesting little subsection of community. If I do start one, it will be posted below.

For accountability, I will maintain the list of outputs below, though this project page may not update every day. I'm also thinking about mirroring the list to the front page of my site to see it better — you'll know it if you see it.
