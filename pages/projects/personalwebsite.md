Hello! I made a website for showing off my project portfolio, posting "sorry for not posting" blog posts, and hosting an About Me page to make it easier for recruiters to find and ignore links to my Github, Youtube, and food blog.

Here's what it looks like now :(. Function before fashion, as they say. I'm working on the projects tab and header, after that I can make it pretty (I say that now, but I might get lazy and rationalize that it won't change anyone's opinion of me considering I don't value my web dev skills very high on my list of capabilities (That was a really long aside, you must be tired of this sentence by now)).
