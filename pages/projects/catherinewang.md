# üß† Hello! I am Stanford PhD uwu

Hi!! I‚Äôm a PhD student at Stanford who **luvss mice and their brains** üê≠üß†.  
My research is somewhere between neuroscience, data science, and staring at tiny neurons under a microscope until they start to look back at me üëÄ.  

When I‚Äôm not in lab, you can find me:
- Writing overly dramatic captions for my confocal images  
- Naming my mice after Shakespeare characters  
- Accidentally spending 3 hours debugging code that had a missing semicolon  
- Talking too loudly about dynamic capabilities at coffee shops

## üìö My Papers (pls cite me üëâüëà)

### [Entrepreneurial Learning: Past Research and Future Challenges](https://doi.org/10.1111/ijmr.12007)
*Catherine L. Wang, Harveen Chugh*  
Published: 31 January 2013  
> A paper that has nothing to do with mice, but everything to do with learning (just like my mice do in mazes üê≠‚û°Ô∏èüßÄ).

---

### [Dynamic capabilities: A review and research agenda](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2370.2007.00201.x)
*Catherine L. Wang, Pervaiz K. Ahmed*  
Published: 28 February 2007  
> The ‚Äúdynamic capabilities‚Äù here refer to companies‚Ä¶ but I like to imagine it‚Äôs about my brain cells firing dynamically after too much coffee.

### Organisational learning: a critical review
*Catherine L. Wang; Pervaiz K. Ahmed*  
Available to Purchase (yes I know, academia paywalls are pain ü´†)  
> If you pay for this one, I owe you a coffee.

## üñºÔ∏è Random Fun

- Here‚Äôs a plot of my sleep schedule during grant season: `function(your_sleep) = chaos(t)`
- Here is a stock photo of a mouse that I pretend is my experimental subject:

## üì¨ Contact

- **Email:** probably writing a draft instead of answering you üìß  
- **Twitter/X:** tweeting memes about neuroanatomy üêÄ  
- **GitHub:** where I put code that miraculously works  
- **Office hours:** basically never (unless there is free pizza)
